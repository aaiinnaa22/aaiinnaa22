Hello! I’m Aina Albrecht, a junior software developer and recent graduate of Hive Helsinki.

My background is rooted in low-level C and C++ development, where I built a strong understanding of memory management, system-level programming, and problem-solving.

I’m currently transitioning into full-stack web development, combining my low-level foundation with modern web technologies to build robust and maintainable applications.

I’m passionate about learning, writing clean and efficient code, and continuously improving as a developer.
